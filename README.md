## Overview

Welcome to the Codecademy Project: Building Interactive Websites - Challenge Project: Number Guesser, completes as part of the Codecademy curriculum for the Full-Stack Engineering Path.

This project contained a series of open-ended requirements which described the project I had to build. I was expected to use resources on Codecademy, the internet, any other resources if I encountered any problems I could not easily solve. I wrote JavaScript functions to power a small guessing game.
